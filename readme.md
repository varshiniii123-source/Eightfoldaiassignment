- **Simple**: "Tell me about Google"
- **Specific**: "Research Tesla's AI and autonomous driving strategy"
- **Voice**: Click the 🎤 microphone button and speak
- **Follow-up**: "Can you dig deeper into their risks?"
- **Update**: "Update the opportunities section to focus on emerging markets"
- **View Sources**: Click "X sources used" to see research URLs

## 🎭 User Persona Demonstrations

This agent handles diverse user types as required by the assignment:

### 1. The Confused User ✅
```
User: "I need help with something"
Agent: "I can help you research companies and generate strategic account plans. 
       Which company are you interested in?"
User: "Um, maybe something in tech?"
Agent: "Could you tell me the specific company name? For example, Apple, Microsoft, or Google?"
```

### 2. The Efficient User ✅
```
User: "Research Salesforce"
Agent: "Great! I'll research Salesforce for you. This will take a moment..."
[Generates full plan in ~15 seconds with 20+ sources]
```

### 3. The Chatty User ✅
```
User: "Hey! How's your day going?"
Agent: "I specialize in researching companies and creating strategic account plans. 
       Which company would you like to learn about?"
```

### 4. The Edge Case User ✅
```
User: "Write me a poem"
Agent: "I specialize in researching companies and creating strategic account plans. 
       Could you tell me which company you'd like to learn about?"
```

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### Why LangGraph?
- **Agentic Loops**: Unlike simple LLM chains, LangGraph allows the agent to critique its own research and refine it
- **State Management**: Clean way to track conversation history, research data, and plan sections
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new nodes (e.g., "Conflict Resolution" for contradictory data)

### Why Conversational Interface?
- **Evaluation Criteria**: The assignment prioritizes "Conversational Quality" over functionality
- **User Experience**: Natural language is more accessible than forms
- **Flexibility**: Handles ambiguous requests, follow-ups, and clarifications

### Why Streaming?
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Users see progress ("📊 Researching...", "🛍️ Analyzing...")
- **Transparency**: Meets the requirement to "Provide updates during research"
- **Engagement**: Keeps users informed during the 15-20 second research process

### Why Tavily over DuckDuckGo?
- **Quality**: Tavily is purpose-built for LLM research (returns structured, relevant data)
- **Reliability**: More consistent results for company research
- **Fallback**: DuckDuckGo is still available if Tavily API is unavailable
